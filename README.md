# Hierarchical Clustering-Based Asset Allocation

This study is based on the research of <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2840729"> Thomas Raffinot (2018)</a>, in which the author considers the application of hierarchical clustering algorithms: single-linkage clustering, complete-linkage clustering, average-linkage clustering, Ward's method and the directed bubble hierarchical tree to achieve diversification. 

In this study, this presented methodology is implemented in stock markets of the BRICS countries.
